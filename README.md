# Project Description

Target of the project is the technology development of Ka-band satellite communication antennas for aeronautical applications based on the knowledge obtained during previous SANTANA and SAMOA projects. Central to the TUHH's approach is the Rx/Tx integration in a single aperture and the use of two circular polarizations.
