@W: MT529 :"f:\tuhh\hiwi\fpga\git_workdir\pico_dev_test\heartbeat.vhd":27:1:27:2|Found inferred clock top_module|sys_clk_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including HeartBeatInst0.iCounter[24:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
