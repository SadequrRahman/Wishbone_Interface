@W: MT529 :"d:\workingdir\fpga\pico_dev_test\i2c_master_controller.vhd":106:1:106:2|Found inferred clock top_module|sys_clk_inferred_clock which controls 15 sequential elements including i2c_master_controller_Inst0.wb_cyc_i. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
