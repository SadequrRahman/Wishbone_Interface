@W: MT531 :"d:\workingdir\fpga\pico_dev_test\wb_manager.vhd":110:2:110:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 19 sequential elements including i2c_master_controller_Inst0.wb_manager0.nState[0:5].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
