@W: MT531 :"d:\workingdir\fpga\pico_dev_test\wb_manager.vhd":153:2:153:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 15 sequential elements including wb_manager_inst.nState[5].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\workingdir\fpga\pico_dev_test\heartbeat.vhd":30:1:30:2|Found inferred clock top_module|sys_clk_inferred_clock which controls 39 sequential elements including HeartBeatInst0.iCounter[3:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
